As one of the more complex bbcode users, I am rather confident this supports everything you normal people want.
This can also be run in the browser console if you do not have a userscript manager.

Main bug atm is the interface for the profile page. Still trying to think of a good way to fix that.
Main missing feature atm is URL link generation without url tags. IDK why I didn't add that in yet....

Not planned:
  * @mention link generation. We do not know the user's id so we cannot generate a link, cannot be sure the user exists, so a dummy link could be misleading. And running a MD search for the user would be a waste of resources because lets face it, you do not want to visit their profile page anyways.
