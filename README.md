# Mangadex-Userscripts
Userscripts for Mangadex.

My personal favorite ATM is bbcode-autocomplete.
It currently only completes \@mentions, but is a quite welcome addition for someone who can't remember nor spell worth crap.
In the future, I plan to additionally autocomplete Manga Titles (creating a bbcode link).

#### Release locations:
* Libraries on github.
* UserScript on github and greasyfork

Gresyfork gets UserScript updates via Github webhook on the stable branch. Libraries point to github.

I will not be hosting the libraries on GreasyFork for the time being, since updating them requires publishing library, parsing site for the unique library version link (different from the \@version tag we control), and then updating the versions links in \@require. My UserScripts will still be hosted there for easy installation however.
