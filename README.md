# Mangadex-Userscripts
Userscripts for Mangadex.

#### [Mangadex Autocomplete](https://github.com/Brandon-Beck/Mangadex-Userscripts/raw/stable/bbcode-autocomplete.user.js)
My personal favorite ATM.
Currently only completes \@mentions to recently seen usernames. Quite welcome addition for someone who can't remember nor spell worth crap.
In the future, I plan to additionally autocomplete Manga Titles (creating a bbcode link).

#### Release locations:
* Libraries on github.
* UserScript on github and greasyfork

Gresyfork gets UserScript updates via Github webhook on the stable branch. Libraries point to github.
